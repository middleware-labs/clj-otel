All `clj-otel-*` module versions are released in lockstep to Clojars.

`x.y.z` versions listed below do not follow semantic versioning.
Instead, development proceeds on a linear path where `z` increases for batches of incremental changes and `y` increases (with `z` reset to `0`) when milestones are reached.

Breaking changes will be documented here.

WARNING: Until version `1.0.0` there is a greater possibility of breaking changes, highlighted with icon:warning[] below.

== `0.x` changes

=== `0.1.12` (in progress)

- Add support for Metrics API
- Add implementations of the following https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/metrics/semantic_conventions/http-metrics/[HTTP server metrics] for use by applications not run with the OpenTelemetry instrumentation agent:
* `http.server.active_requests`
* `http.server.duration`
* `http.server.request.size`
- icon:warning[] The parameters for function `add-route-data!` have changed, there is a new parameter to specify the HTTP request method.
- icon:warning[] The pattern for using `clj-otel` middleware and interceptors in applications has been revised.
The revised pattern uses new middleware `wrap-route` and interceptor `route-interceptor` to capture matched routes in HTTP server spans.
The pattern also ensures all requests are traced, including those which do not match any route.
- New module `clj-otel-instrumentation-runtime-metrics` to provide access to JVM runtime metrics instrumentation for applications not using the OpenTelemetry instrumentation agent.
- Added aliases in examples
** `:metrics-*` to control export of metrics
** `:logging-*` to control application logging
- Bump deps:
* OpenTelemetry `1.24.0`
** icon:warning[] When using autoconfiguration for a manually instrumented application, include the new JVM option `"-Dotel.java.global-autoconfigure.enabled=true"` or environment variable setting `OTEL_JAVA_GLOBAL_AUTOCONFIGURE_ENABLED=true`
** Methods to statically set the server host name attribute on server spans have been removed, as static data is better represented as an OpenTelemetry resource.
*** icon:warning[] The function `add-server-name!` has been removed.
*** icon:warning[] The option `:server-name` has been removed from the middleware and interceptors for server span support.
** icon:warning[] Module `clj-otel-extension-aws` renamed to `clj-otel-contrib-aws-xray-propagator`
** icon:warning[] Module `clj-otel-sdk-extension-aws` renamed to `clj-otel-contrib-aws-resources`
** icon:warning[] Module `clj-otel-sdk-extension-resources` renamed to `clj-otel-instrumentation-resources`
